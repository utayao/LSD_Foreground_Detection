1. Installation

Our code needs the software "SPAMS", which can be downloaded from 

http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/downloads.html

* This toolbox is included in this package. Please note that you might need to recompile this toolbox by simply running
./spams-matlab/compile.m


2. Run the code

Just simply run LSD_demo.m
